# PeopleSoft-AI-ML-based-chatbot
To create a project that connects to a PeopleSoft database, analyzes data, and implements an AI/ML-based chatbot, you'll need a structured approach. Below is a Python code outline that includes steps for connecting to an Oracle database, analyzing the data, and implementing an Isolation Forest-based chatbot.
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

bash

pip install cx_Oracle pandas scikit-learn

Step 2: Connect to the PeopleSoft Database

You will need to configure the connection to your Oracle database.

python

import cx_Oracle
import pandas as pd

def connect_to_oracle_db(user, password, dsn):
    try:
        connection = cx_Oracle.connect(user=user, password=password, dsn=dsn)
        print("Connected to Oracle Database")
        return connection
    except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as e:
        print(f"Database connection error: {e}")
        return None

Step 3: Read Data from Tables

You can create a function to read data from specified tables.

python

def read_data_from_table(connection, table_name):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}"
    try:
        df = pd.read_sql(query, connection)
        print(f"Data from {table_name} loaded successfully.")
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading data from {table_name}: {e}")
        return None

Step 4: Analyze Data and Check for Missing Values

This function will check for missing data and relationships between tables.

python

def analyze_data(df):
    print("Analyzing data...")
    print("Missing values:")
    print(df.isnull().sum())
    
    # Additional analysis could go here
    # For example: checking relationships between tables

Step 5: Implement Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection

Using the Isolation Forest algorithm from scikit-learn to detect anomalies in the dataset.

python

from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

def detect_anomalies(df):
    # Assuming 'feature_columns' is a list of columns to analyze
    feature_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()
    model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)  # Adjust contamination based on your needs
    df['anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(df[feature_columns])
    
    anomalies = df[df['anomaly'] == -1]
    print(f"Detected {len(anomalies)} anomalies.")
    return anomalies

Step 6: Create a Basic Chatbot Structure

Implementing a simple chatbot structure to interact with users about issues and suggestions.

python

class SimpleChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.responses = {
            "missing_data": "It seems there are missing values in the data. Please check the relevant tables.",
            "anomaly_detected": "An anomaly has been detected. Would you like more details?",
            "help": "I can help with data analysis and anomaly detection. Ask me anything!"
        }

    def respond(self, user_input):
        if "missing" in user_input:
            return self.responses["missing_data"]
        elif "anomaly" in user_input:
            return self.responses["anomaly_detected"]
        elif "help" in user_input:
            return self.responses["help"]
        else:
            return "I'm sorry, I don't understand that."

def chat_with_user():
    bot = SimpleChatbot()
    print("Welcome to the PeopleSoft AI Chatbot! Type 'exit' to end the chat.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        response = bot.respond(user_input)
        print(f"Bot: {response}")

Step 7: Main Execution Block

This section will execute the functions defined above.

python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user = "your_username"
    password = "your_password"
    dsn = "your_dsn"  # e.g., "localhost/orcl"

    connection = connect_to_oracle_db(user, password, dsn)
    
    if connection:
        # Load data from a specific table
        table_name = "your_table_name"
        data = read_data_from_table(connection, table_name)

        if data is not None:
            analyze_data(data)
            anomalies = detect_anomalies(data)
            chat_with_user()
        
        connection.close()

Final Notes

    Database Configuration: Ensure that your Oracle client and database are properly configured. You may need to install Oracle Instant Client if you haven't done so.

    Anomaly Detection: Fine-tune the Isolation Forest parameters based on your specific data characteristics and needs.

    Chatbot Enhancements: This is a basic structure; consider enhancing it with more complex dialogue management, logging, and response generation based on actual data analysis results.

    Security: Always handle sensitive information (like database credentials) securely and avoid hardcoding them in your code.

This outline provides a foundation for your project. You can expand upon each component based on your specific requirements and use cases.
